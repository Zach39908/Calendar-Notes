# SnapShots
SnapShots is an app that allows you to store text notes for specific dates on a yearly calendar. You can use SnapShots for a variety of use cases including those listed below.

- Track Deadlines
- Notes for Studying
- Yearly Diary

Your notes are stored within your browser's local storage. This means that notes are only accessible on the device and browser which they were created on. This was done for app design simplicity currently.

## How To Use
Access the site using the GitHub pages link [here](https://zach39908.github.io/SnapShots/).<br>
<br>
Using the calendar interface, you can navigate to any specific date within the current year. Notes tied to that date can then be created, read, updated, or deleted as desired. Additionally, you can search for any saved notes throughout the year using the search bar at the top of the page.

## About This App
This is a vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript project developed for the purpose of providing attached timestamps to user notes using a simple calendar interface. SnapShots uses responsive layouts for mobile and desktop screens.

## Coming Features
- SnapShots was designed for simplicity by running purely on the client-side. However, future plans may involve implementing a backend architecture including Cloud storage for accessing notes across multiple devices and browsers.
